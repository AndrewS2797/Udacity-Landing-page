# Landing Page Project
This project is for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program profissional web track.


## Description

This is a basic landing page that is made dynamically with **javascript**, **css**, and **html**.


### What has been done?

- A new section has been added to the body.
- I linked the javascript file to the html file. 
- A dynamic NavBar is made to add up new navbar links if new sections is made.
- A smooth scroll is made to each link of the sections using javascript.
- A section active state is made to focus on the section that is being viewed using javascript.
- A back to top button is made by javascript, css, html, to appear after section 2 being scrolled.
- The navbar dissappears after 6 seconds when not scrolling to give users more space to read.
- Some changes in Css has been made for better view looking.
